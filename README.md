# Stealth-UI-Framework
Stealth is a quick and easy way to design consistent and responsive web interfaces. Stealth comes packed with pre-made CSS classes that can easily structure a web interface. It's still a work in progress, as I will be adding new classes as I find need.

# How To Use
## Responsive Grid System
Stealth uses a 12-column grid system to design responsive interfaces.
<code>
  <div class="section group">
    <div class="col col-6"></div>
    <div class="col col-6"></div>
  </div>
</code>
