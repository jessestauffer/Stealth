# Stealth-UI-Framework
Stealth is a quick and easy way to design consistent and responsive web interfaces. Stealth comes packed with pre-made CSS classes that can easily structure a web interface. It's still a work in progress, as I will be adding new classes as I find need.

# How To Use
## Responsive Grid System
Stealth uses a 12-column grid system to design responsive interfaces. The class `col-#` represents how many 1/12 columns the column will take up. You can create a grid with 2 equivalent columns like this:

 ```
 <div class="section group">
 
    <div class="col col-6">
      This is column 1
    </div>
    
    <div class="col col-6">
      This is column 2
    </div>
    
  </div>
 ```
 
 Likewise, you can create a grid with 3 equivalent columns like this:
 
  ```
 <div class="section group">
 
    <div class="col col-4">
      This is column 1
    </div>
    
    <div class="col col-4">
      This is column 2
    </div>
    
    <div class="col col-4">
      This is column 2
    </div>
    
  </div>
 ```
